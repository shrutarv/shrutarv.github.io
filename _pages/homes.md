Welcome to my academic homepage!  
I am a graduate student with a strong interest in **robotics**, **computer vision**, and **autonomous systems**. I’m currently working on high-speed autonomous navigation using event cameras and am passionate about building intelligent, perception-driven robotic platforms.

My recent work focuses on:

- High-speed robot perception using **event-based cameras**
- Dynamic object detection in **cluttered indoor environments**
- Dataset generation and deep learning for real-time tracking
- Localization and collision avoidance for autonomous systems

### 🛠️ Projects

- **Dynamic Obstacle Detection with Event Cameras**  
  Developed a pipeline to segment and localize moving obstacles using event-based vision data captured in VICON-enabled environments.

- **Dataset Creation for Event-Based Neural Networks**  
  Designed and annotated a custom dataset using synchronized RGB and event camera data to train neural networks for bounding box generation.

- **High-Speed Robot Navigation Stack**  
  Implemented real-time localization and collision avoidance strategies for robots moving >10 m/s indoors.
